        <h2>NOTABLE ACHIVEMENTS</h2>

        <h4>All around Europe with scholarships & EVS</h4>
        <p>Already in primary school got the chance to visit Reutlingen, Tübingen and Stuttgart and improve some German language skills at our partner school.</p>
        <d3>In secondary school managed a language tuition in Broadstairs and spent some amazing days in London and Cambridge. </d3>
        <p>Later on there came other possibilities to enjoy two semesters at Radboud University in the Netherlands and having a nice summer 'uni' session at Frei University in Berlin with some other students from 56 different countries. In the Netherlands I could pass a 'Dutch' language exam and write my thesis about a very unique civil law system and had exciting debates about legalised prostitution, drugs and euthanasy. Also DAAD offered in Berlin not only improved language skills but also a chance to get know more and more about history of the city and the country supported by different task lists for every day to make short films or to ask questions directly from 'Berliner'. Every quest was supported with a printed map to discover a different part of the city every afternoon. </p>
        <p>EVS also offered 10 month in Luxemburg to organise free time activities for a group of youngsters with different disabilities. It was also a very well organised program with many other young voluntiers from all around Europe. I could learn a lot about my host institution, how to deal with people with special needs, what are the legal backgrounds for such organisations and maintaining the everyday life of habitants. </p>
